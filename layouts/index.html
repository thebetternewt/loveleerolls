        We would love to sit down at our kitchen table and tell you how this all
        started. Doesn’t that sound odd? You might be thinking, “Don’t you mean
        discuss it over lunch and consistent cell phone use?” Your kitchen may
        not even have a table. Or if it does, it is probably a lonely place or a
        piece of furniture positioned so you can watch Netflix from in other room.
        And that’s Ok!
      </p>

        But one thing we have learned throughout this process is that the kitchen
        and the table are special places. It’s where you share life with one
        another. It’s where people come in and experience the home.

        We started LoveLee Rolls in July of 2015 on our way back from the beach
        and it has been an interesting journey to say the least. It had been the
        perfect storm of an old college friend talking about how they were still
        the best cinnamon rolls he had ever had (six years later) and another
        friend asking us to make a batch for her to keep in her freezer. We
        thought, “I wonder if people would really buy these rolls?” We had been
        married for just over a year and our wedding theme was, “A LoveLee
        Wedding” (Might just be a Southern thing?) so we decided to give it a
        shot. LoveLee Rolls was born!
